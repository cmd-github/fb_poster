# 📢 Facebook Auto-Poster Bot

This script automates **scheduled posts to Facebook Pages** using the **Meta Graph API**.  
It allows different **clients (users)** to post **daily AI tips, messages, or images** from a structured file, based on a predefined schedule.

---

## 🚀 **How It Works**
1. The script reads **a text file (`ai_tips.txt`)** containing messages with **date-based selection**.
2. It selects the message for **today's date** (if available).
3. It picks a **random or sequential image** from the client’s folder.
4. It **posts the selected message and image** to the specified **Facebook Page**.

---

## ⚙️ **How to Modify Variables**
### **1️⃣ Configuring Clients & Facebook Tokens**
Each **client (user)** has a unique **Facebook Page Token & Page ID**.  
These are stored in a **GitHub Secret** (`TOKENS`) in **JSON format**.

#### **Modify in GitHub Secrets (`Settings > Secrets > Actions`):**
```json
{
  "me": {
    "FB_PAGE_TOKEN": "EAA...me_token...",
    "FB_PAGE_ID": "540357995832682"
  },
  "client1": {
    "FB_PAGE_TOKEN": "EAA...ryan_token...",
    "FB_PAGE_ID": "61572882148229"
  },
  "client2": {
    "FB_PAGE_TOKEN": "EAA...paul_token...",
    "FB_PAGE_ID": "123456789"
  }
}

Setting Up Message Files
Each client has a separate text file with their daily messages.

The script finds today’s date in the file and posts that message.
If today’s date is missing, no post is made.

Example: ai_tips.txt Format
2025-02-27: AI tip: Chatbots can help brainstorm your next adventure.
2025-02-28: AI tip: Automate repetitive tasks using AI-powered workflows.
2025-02-29: AI tip: AI can summarize long articles in seconds.
2025-03-01: AI tip: Use AI for sentiment analysis to understand customer feedback.


Setting Up Image Selection
    Images must be stored inside the images/ folder.
    Each client has a subfolder (images/me, images/client1, images/client2).
    Modes:
    random → Selects a random image each time.
    sequential → Picks images in order based on today’s date.

🕒 Automating with GitHub Actions
    The script runs automatically using GitHub Actions, according to a schedule defined in .github/workflows/me.yml.
    Changing the Schedule
        Edit .github/workflows/me.yml:
        on:
        schedule:
            - cron: '0 10,16 * * *'  # Runs at 10 AM and 4 PM UTC daily
    Use crontab.guru to customize the schedule.

🚀 Manually Running the Script
    If you want to run the script manually:
        Go to GitHub → Actions.
        Select the "Post for Me" workflow.
        Click "Run Workflow".

❓ Troubleshooting
    No post today?
    → Check if today’s date is in ai_tips.txt.
    Image not found?
    → Ensure images exist in images/<client>/ folder.
    GitHub Actions failed?
    → View logs under GitHub → Actions → Workflow Run.

🔒 Security & Best Practices
    Never commit sensitive API tokens.
    Use GitHub Secrets for storing tokens.
    Limit API permissions (only pages_manage_posts required).
    **Review GitHub Actions logs for any errors
